US Open: Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz wins in five sets to reach quarter-finalsLast updated on9 hours ago9 hours ago.From the sectionTennisCarlos AlcarazAlcaraz is the youngest men's Grand Slam singles quarter-finalist since Michael Chang at the 1990 French OpenUS Open 2021Venue: Flushing Meadows, New York Date: 30 August-12 SeptemberCoverage: Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra/BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and appSpanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz continued his sensational US Open debut by coming from behind to beat German Peter Gojowczyk in five sets and reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final.Alcaraz, 18, recovered from two-sets-to-one down to win 5-7 6-1 5-7 6-2 6-0.The victory sees Alcaraz become the youngest player in the Open era to reach the US Open men's last eight.The world number 55 will face Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime next in New York.The 12th seed came from a set down to defeat the USA's Frances Tiafoe 4-6 6-2 7-6 (8-6) 6-4."I'm super excited to be in my first second week in the Grand Slam, so it's amazing for me. It's a dream come true," Alcaraz said."It's really tough to play these kind of matches, to play fifth sets. I hope to play more second weeks, to play more quarter-finals of Grand Slams."I didn't expect to play quarter-finals here. So I think it's a really good performance from me in these matches."ADVERTISEMENTLive scores, results and order of playAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phoneSpain's talented young star Alcaraz announced himself on one of the sport's grandest stages as he stunned Greek third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth set tie-break in the previous round.That seismic victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium, after which he thanked the crowd for playing their part, made him the youngest men's singles player to reach the US Open fourth round in 32 years.This time out on a packed Grandstand court, the Spaniard fell behind to 32-year-old qualifier Gojowczyk, as the world number 141 battled back from a double break of serve down to clinch a rollercoaster opening set.Alcaraz, who at 5-4 had served for a first set which featured seven breaks in all, refused to make the same mistake with a dominant display in the second - converting an early advantage by winning four successive games.The momentum swung again in the third set, as Gojowczyk shrugged off the disappointment of being denied at set point to immediately break back and regain control of the match.An enthralling contest unfortunately did not get the ending it deserved, however.Alcaraz once again rose to the occasion, executing a delightful drop shot to break back for 1-1 in the fourth set before conceding just one more game on his way to setting up a decider.But a struggling Gojowczyk, who received treatment to his right leg before the start of the final set, could offer no resistance as Alcaraz ultimately cruised to victory - becoming the youngest men's singles quarter-finalist at Grand Slam since 1990 in the process.He will not be the only teenager in the last eight of the singles competitions. Canadian Leylah Fernandez will face fifth seed Elina Svitolina for a semi-final spot as, on the eve of her 19th birthday, she defeated 2016 champion Angelique Kerber.They could yet be joined by fellow 18-year-old Emma Raducanu, with the Briton set to face American Shelby Rogers on Monday.Qualifier Van de Zandschulp stuns Schwartzman to set up Medvedev tieBotic van de ZandschulpBotic van de Zandschulp defeated world number 11 Casper Ruud in the second round of the US OpenElsewhere, Dutch qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp stunned Argentine 11th seed Diego Schwartzman in five sets.The world number 117 recovered from losing the third and fourth sets to win 6-3 6-4 5-7 5-7 6-1 and become only the third qualifier to reach the US Open men's quarter-finals.Having not previously been beyond the second round of a Grand Slam, Van de Zandschulp will meet second seed Daniil Medvedev for a place in the last four.Russian Medvedev, the 2019 runner-up, outclassed beat British number one Dan Evans on Sunday and is yet to drop a set after four rounds following his 6-3 6-4 6-3 victory.The 25-year-old Van de Zandschulp turned professional in 2013 but only qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the 2021 Australian Open.The Dutchman had already put out eighth seed Casper Ruud in round two before this latest statement victory over world number 14 Schwartzman, in which he produced 55 winners and 15 aces in an impressive four-hour-and-20-minute display.And his reward for four hard-fought main draw victories in New York - in which he has played an exhausting 18 sets - will be a meeting with two-time major finalist Medvedev in the second week."I don't really have words for it," said Van de Zandschulp, who also had to come through three qualifying matches.

Apple employees make US labour watchdog complaintsPublished2 days agoShareApple store signIMAGE SOURCEGETTY IMAGESTwo employee complaints against Apple are being considered by the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).One alleges retaliation for raising safety concerns, while the other focuses on alleged suppression of questions about pay equity.Apple has declined to comment on individual cases, but says it investigates when a concern is raised.The complaints come as an online campaign says it's received more than 600 stories of workplace problems.The NLRB is an independent US agency which protects the rights of private sector employees to join together to improve their wages and working conditions, and to prevent unfair labour practices.It will look into the so-called "Charge against Employer" filings before deciding whether to take further action.The charges were filed on 26 August and 1 September with the NLRB office in Oakland, California.Equal payThe 1 September charge was filed by an Apple software engineer, Cher Scarlett, who alleges that the company suppressed attempts by workers to organise.In her filings, seen by the BBC, Ms Scarlett alleges that Apple repeatedly blocked employee efforts to survey and discuss pay.The surveys were intended to investigate pay equity concerns.The complaint says that over the past five months, Apple HR stopped "multiple attempts to voluntarily gather wage data among employees".It further alleges that Apple "engaged in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organisers of protected concerted activity".AppletooMs Scarlett, along with colleagues and industry friends, launched the Appletoo website to "demand systematic change" in the workplace."We all share a spot in Directory, and yet, we don't share the same treatment, and aren't all given equal rights", the website says.The site encourages current and former Apple employees to share their stories in order to expose discrimination, harassment and other mistreatment, and to encourage change.Recently Ms Scarlett has begun publishing some of the responses on online publishing platform Medium, five stories at time.So far, she tells the BBC in an email, the "number of stories received is over 600. About a third have agreed to have them shared anonymously".Support is building internally and externally for culture change within Apple, she says.The 26 August filing was made by Ashley Gjovik, a senior engineering program manager at Apple, according to the Reuters news agency.Ms Gjovik's complaints include harassment by a manager, reduced responsibilities and increases in unfavourable work, the news agency reported.She raised concerns in March that her office was an unsafe place to work because of chemical pollution. She claims she then faced retaliation as a result of expressing her fears.In her letter to the NLRB, the Financial Times reports, Ms Gjovik alleges that she was "intimidated" not to speak about her safety concerns.In a statement, Apple told the BBC, "We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace."We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters."

Facebook apology as AI labels black men 'primates'Published3 hours agoShareFacebook under the lens illustrationIMAGE SOURCEGETTY IMAGESFacebook users who watched a newspaper video featuring black men were asked if they wanted to "keep seeing videos about primates" by an artificial-intelligence recommendation system.Facebook told BBC News it "was clearly an unacceptable error", disabled the system and launched an investigation."We apologise to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations."It is the latest in a long-running series of errors that have raised concerns over racial bias in AI.'Genuinely sorry'In 2015, Google's Photos app labelled pictures of black people as "gorillas".The company said it was "appalled and genuinely sorry", though its fix, Wired reported in 2018, was simply to censor photo searches and tags for the word "gorilla".In May, Twitter admitted racial biases in the way its "saliency algorithm" cropped previews of images.Studies have also shown biases in the algorithms powering some facial-recognition systems.Algorithmic errorIn 2020, Facebook announced a new "inclusive product council" - and a new equity team in Instagram - that would examine, among other things, whether its algorithms exhibited racial bias.Google and big tech are 'institutionally racist'IBM abandons 'biased' facial recognition techThe "primates" recommendation "was an algorithmic error on Facebook" and did not reflect the content of the video, a representative told BBC News.ADVERTISEMENT"We disabled the entire topic-recommendation feature as soon as we realised this was happening so we could investigate the cause and prevent this from happening again.""As we have said while we have made improvements to our AI, we know it's not perfect and we have more progress to make."

Artist Banksy's team was warned his website had a security weakness seven days before a hacker scammed a fan out of $336,000 (£242,000). On Tuesday a piece of art was advertised on Banksy's official website as the world-renowned graffiti artist's first NFT (non-fungible token). A British collector won the auction to buy it, before realising it was a fake. A cyber-security expert warned Banksy that the website could be hacked, but was ignored. With NFTs, artwork can be "tokenised" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold. They do not generally give the buyer the actual artwork or its copyright. Sam Curry, a professional ethical hacker from the US and founder of security consultancy Palisade, said he first heard that the site could have a weakness on the social network Discord, last month. Multiple warnings "I was in a security forum and multiple people were posting links to the site. I'd clicked one and immediately saw it was vulnerable, so I reached out to Banksy's team via email as I wasn't sure if anyone else had. ADVERTISEMENT "They didn't respond over email, so I tried a few other ways to contact them including their Instagram, but never received a response." Mr Curry's disclosure, first reported by rekt.news was made initially by email on 25 August. The BBC was shown the email thread and has tried to contact Banksy's team several times, with no response. Banksy adds £200k to old shop's asking price Fake Banksy NFT sold through artist's website A guide to Banksy's 'Great British Spraycation' Mr Curry says the website flaw - which has now been fixed - "allowed you to create arbitrary files on the website" and post your own pages and content.The new page, called 'Banksy.co.uk/NFT', was deleted shortly after the auction, with Banksy's team saying: "Any Banksy NFT auctions are not affiliated with the artist in any shape or form". I felt burned The British man who won the auction is a prominent NFT collector and Banksy fan known on Twitter as Pranksy. He said he felt "burned" when he was scammed out of nearly $340,000 in cryptocurrency coins, but was relieved when the hacker inexplicably returned most of the money to him by the end of the day. Banksy work in Lowestoft IMAGE SOURCEGETTY IMAGES image captionNew paintings have recently been uncovered, as part of Banksy's 'Staycation stunt' He said earlier this week: "I think the press coverage of the hack and me potentially discovering the hackers' ID pushed him into a refund." He says he has ended up around $5,000 out of pocket, as the transaction fee was not refunded. Banksy stunt? The bizarre story has led some to speculate that the incident may have been some sort of Banksy stunt.But Banksy expert Prof Paul Gough, principal and vice-chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, says the timing, art style and set-up doesn't add up. "I don't see it as a Banksy prank. The timing for me doesn't work right, the context doesn't feel appropriate. He's just done his 'Spraycation' stunt where he bombed 10 sites in East Anglia, and put out a video on social media about it. "That is a pretty major stunt and takes a lot of organising by a very professional crew, so I just don't think the timings right here so soon after that." Prof Gough also says the artwork style itself would be a major departure from Banksy's iconic spray-paint stencil style.Some have compared the hack to the infamous stunt where Banksy shredded a piece of art in a live auction.
