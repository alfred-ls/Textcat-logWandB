# ü™ê spaCy & wandb Project: 
## Use Case 02 Text Classification BBC & NG news
+ Using Weights & Biases for logging of training experiments

A textcat project for spaCy v3. The project data comes from kaggle: 
+ BBC (https://www.kaggle.com/hgultekin/bbcnewsarchive)
+ NG (https://www.kaggle.com/salmaelanigri/doc-class)


Label scheme (3 combined labels for 1 component):

| Component | Labels |
| --- | --- |
| **`textcat`** | `tech`, `sport`, `entertainment` |


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows.

### ‚èØ Commands

Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `convert` | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format |
| `train` | Train the textcat model and log the results via wandb |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the model and export metrics |
| `package` | Package the trained model as a pip package |
| `visualize-model` | Visualize the model's output interactively using Streamlit |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `convert` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` |

### üóÇ Assets
